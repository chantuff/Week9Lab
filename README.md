# React Week 9 Lab - App is working

1. Went to https://api.nasa.gov to get free API Key
2. Read through documentation to find out what information I wanted to retrieve in my app. Once I figured that out, look for base URL and endpoint
3. Determined what and how I wanted the data displayed based on directions given for project
4. Mapped out what components and pages were needed
5. Created app using npm create vite@latest
6. Installed React Router using npm install react-router-dom
7. Created components and pages
8. Once components and pages are created, created broilerplate code for each using (rfce)
9. Imported needed components into App.jsx or wherever they are going to be used
10. In main.jsx, wrapped Router component around App component
